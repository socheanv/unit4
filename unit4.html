Hello guys my name is Tommy Vean, I enjoy spending my free time cooking and eating. Recently I have been trying some new spots in KC every week, since I am adventurous person. I plan on traveling this year back to my home state California and to other places throughout the country. By next year, my goal is to get my passport and travel to Europe.
